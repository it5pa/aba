Title: Three Categories

----

Text:

Tune in to Colaboradio via Freies Radio Berlin/Brandenburg 88,4 MHz in Berlin 90,7 MHz in Potsdam or listen online here to catch a collective listening session/radio performance hosted by formed ABA resident, Dutch/Hungarian artist Dóra Benyó and the Belgo-German artist duo Office for Joint Administrative Intelligence (O.J.A.I).

The listening session Three Categories will take place at Max in Brussels.

Central to the piece are the declassified secret service files compiled after the surveillance of Benyó's grandfather, a research engineer and political activist during Hungary's communist era.Our collaboration reimagines the architecture of the state archive, transforming it into a conceptual space representing totalitarian overreach through the excessive production of knowledge. O.J.A.I. contributes to this transformation by creating paranoid organizational atmospheres, conveyed through a series of fictional texts and modular sound compositions.

This project was developed by Dóra Benyó during her residency at ABA in 2024, which was generously supported by the Mondrian Funds.

Farrelly's practice is supported by the Arts Council of Ireland.
