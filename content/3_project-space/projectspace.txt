    *Itâ€™s okay now* is an autobiographical work that, through the practice of remembering, questions, analyzes, and compares the origins and identities of the two protagonists. Remembering serves not only as a means of reflection but also as a form of dreaming and processing the past. Fictional scenes and archival material intertwine to create a narrative that merges personal and collective memories.


    The exhibition is accompanied by an events programme including but not limited to karaoke.

    Don't go there alone. Supervised corner for beginners and advanced players. Excursions into the surrounding area without sturdy shoes, seeing and being seen in good weather. Changing programme, activities and discussions about the neighborhood and what art has to do with it.

    We are happy to welcome the artist Carsten Lisecki at our project space until the end of May. After just having published his book *Der Arbeitsaufenthalt als Beitrag zur Erholungsforschung*, Lisecki engaged with the space and developed new work.

    Caught between emotions and emojis.
    Motionless sharing,
    shares and likes.
    I like when thereâ€™s nothingâ€¦
    When thereâ€™s nothing left to do!
    Dividing the emotions
    into Emoâ€™s & -tionâ€™s.
    Dark shadowed eyes smiling at me,
    when I come to this place to forget.
    To this place, where I feel to much
    but can stop thinking and just sink in.
    Like under a thick cosy blanket,
    where everything is dark and silent.

About:

Our project space is located in the middle of a culturally diverse and lively district of Berlin. Here we offer artists an exhibition space where they can show their work to a wider audience and enter into an exchange with the local communities. We also offer artists at every stage of their career a space to explore and experiment. We hold workshops and readings to encourage exchange between communities and promote critical thinking through collaborative projects. The aim of our project space is to make connections and engage with artists, thinkers and institutions from different fields of knowledge and expertise.

The space is available for hire to be used as an event space or studio space. If you would like to know more about the use of space or submit a proposal, please send us a request, and we will review it.

  title: 'Ruins of Belarus'
  artist: 'Uladzimir Hramovich & VEHA Archive'
  start_date: '2024-11-09'
  end_date: '2024-11-28'
  image: []
  description: |-
    In his artistic work, Uladzimir Hramovich focuses on political movements and architecture in relation to their inherent history. His work is based on documentary material and complemented by subjective narratives.

    Forced into exile, the Berlin-based artist is now cut off from the sources in Belarus. For the VEHA archive, Hramovich bought photographs on eBay of Belarusian monuments and their deterioration during the German occupation. In the exhibition Ruins of Belarus, he combines these images with other objects and attributes of power claimed by the current regime in Belarus. By manipulating them, Hramovich creates a critical reinterpretation and offers an alternative perspective to the hegemonic, centralized historiography.

    After the exhibition, the images will be integrated into the collection of the independent VEHA archive. In the face of the horrific destruction in the neighbouring country, VEHA focuses on the destroyed architecture, villages and cities in Belarus that have fallen victim to war, modernisation, repression and the contempt of the current regime.
  bio: 'Uladzimir Hramovich sees materials such as concrete, granite, metal, paper and paint not just as surfaces on which history leaves its mark, but as agents that themselves deform history. His artistic practice draws on the history of modernist art and architecture, the history of ideology and political movements.'

  title: 'At your fingertips, I see my moving lips or not?'
  artist: 'Sylvia Heinrich'

    I doubt, I am no longer sure: Did I see that or did I dream it? What did I see? Is there still a referent or is it just a sampling of â€˜dustedâ€™ images?

    New technologies are rapidly changing the images of our world. We have to constantly relearn how to read and decipher them and come to terms with how power relations are constantly shifting. Bound to their fluid materiality, digital images can be intercepted, copied or modified at lightning speed at any time. Even the â€˜originalâ€™ code of an image is not a static entity. Similar to a musical score, it is constantly reinterpreted by various technical devices and temporarily performed on their surfaces.

    In the continuation of Sylvia Henrich's exhibition for EMOP Berlin 2023, an array of images and their production methods once again enter into dialogue â€”subjectivity meets autocorrection.

    Just as Sabine Weier writes, through a â€˜umstÃ¼rzlerischen Umgang mit technischen Verfahren' ( subversive approach to technical processes ), the artist creates collisions that reveal underlying structures and open up new spaces of imagination.
